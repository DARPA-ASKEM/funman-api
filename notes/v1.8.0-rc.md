- pde2petri package: 
  - Documentation
    - Discretizing PDEs
    - Expressing Derivatives as Rate Laws
    - Examples: Halfar Ice Dome and Advection
    - Manual encoding of example instances
    - Automated encoding of vector calculus models
- Enhancements:
  - Refined plotting of parameter space as a grid of plots for all pairs of parameters.  Removed the diagonal from the grid that plots a parameter against itself (i.e., the identity relataionship).
  - Improve parsing of unsat cores generated by minisat by using a pysmt parser instead of regular expression based substitution.
  - Add animated plotting for PDE model witness points that animates a 1D or 2D spatial variable over time.  
  - Speed up generation of first parameter region using witness-based depth-first search
  - Refined generation of witness point traces to support Terrarium presentation
  - Improved handling of layered SMT encodings.  
  - funman command line executable
  ```bash 
  funman -h
  usage: funman [-h] [-o OUTDIR] [-p] model request

  positional arguments:
    model                 model json file
    request               request json file

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
                          Output directory
    -p, --plot            Write plots in outdir.
